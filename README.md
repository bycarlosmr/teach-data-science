## Overview

Success in data science and statistics is dependent on the development
of both analytical and computational skills. As statistics educators we
are more familiar and comfortable with teaching the former, but the
latter is becoming increasingly important. The goal of this workshop is
to equip educators with concrete information on content and
infrastructure for painlessly introducing modern computation into a data
science and/or statistics curriculum. In addition to gaining technical
knowledge, participants will engage in discussion around the decisions
that go into choosing infrastructure and developing curriculum. Workshop
attendees will work through several exercises from existing courses and
get first-hand experience with using relevant tool-chains and
techniques, including R/RStudio, literate programming with R Markdown,
and collaboration, version control, and automated feedback with
Git/GitHub. We will also discuss best practices for configuring and
deploying classroom infrastructures to support these tools. This
workshop is aimed at participants who are interested in the role of
computing in either a Statistics or Data Science curriculum, including
faculty designing new courses/programs and those interested in adding or
improving a computational component to an existing course. A basic
knowledge of R is assumed and familiarity with Git is preferred.
